# SinglePageApplication

This is the sample of single page application using ASP.NET MVC (.NET 4.5.2) and angular.js (v1.8.0).

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. (wikipedia)
